# LUMEN-2025_BUIFER
Development of the hardware and software for smart protection helmet used by construction workers. Three PCBs were design in order to expand the functionalities of the regular protection helmet, code-named after their location on the helmet: BackPCB, FrontPCB and SidePCB. Code written in C, built and loaded into the STM32L476 and ESP Wrover microcontrollers. Implemented local web application developed in React to visualize data from sensors and to notify user about important informations on the construction site. The whole system was tested and proved functional and efficient.
